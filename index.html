          “Whatever you go into, you have to go in there to be the best. There are no formulas. It's all about passion, honesty, and hard work. It might look glamorous, but it takes a lot of hard work. The blessing with the arts is that you can do it forever.” —<cite>Hugh Masekela </cite>

        <blockquote>
          “Our contribution purely depends on our consciousness and our willingness to support those in need, to show vulnerability and accept the support of others, to give it our all, allow our hard work to decide the outcome, and to understand that control can only be achieved with a shared responsibility.” — <cite>Yehuda Berg </cite>
